# Soccer

This tutorial is broken down into two parts:

In the [Part 1](#part-1---single-player-soccer), you learn to build a simple
single player soccer game by following a clearly outlined set of steps:

</a>

Then in [Part 2](#part-2---adding-more-functionality) (_still under
construction_), we will show you a variety of additional functionality that you
can add to your game. You'll pick and choose what you think is cool.

Here is an example of what you could make from what you learn:

## How to Use This Tutorial

Don't feel that you have to follow along step-by-step. Figure out the best way
to navigate this tutorial for you. This might look like the following:

**If you have never programmed before:**

- Amazing! Walk through the tutorial step-by-step! We got your back!

**If you have programmed a _little_:**

- Huzzah! Feel free to follow along step-by-step and skim through a sections
  you understand.

**If you have more experience:**

- You already know the basics of coding. Your goal here is to learn how to use
  the JavaScript game frameworks [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) and
  [p5.play.js](p5play.molleindustria.org) and then make your own stuff with it.
- You might spend most of your jumping around from section to section and just
  picking and choosing what you need.

## Setup

1. If you're more experienced and want to use your own editor
   follow [these instructions](own_editor.md).

2. If you haven't already, make sure you have a JS Bin account first.
   <a href="https://jsbin.com/register" target="_blank">Create one here.</a>

3. Then open <a target="_blank"
   href="http://jsbin.com/rekofi/120/edit?js,output"> this JS Bin</a>.
   It has all the starter code we need for this tutorial. Write any new code in
   this JS Bin. We'll refer to this JS Bin as your **_"working bin"_**.

## Some Quick Vocabulary

Each interactive element in the game (the player, ball, and the goal) is called a
**_sprite_**.

## Part 1 - Single Player Soccer

The below steps walk you through step-by-step of how to build a the single
player soccer game.

## Part 2 - Adding More Functionality

**_Note that this section is still under construction. For now, checkout:_**

1. The code for soccer example at the top of the page
2. The [Dodge workshop](../dodge/README.md)

Think of this section like the like the topping bar of an ice cream store. You
can sprinkle as many or as little of the below features on the maze game that
you built in the [Linear Tutorial](#linear-tutorial) in any order you please!

## F.A.Q

**What programming languages and libraries are we using?**

- We are learning to us  JavaScript game framework [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) and
[p5.play.js](p5play.molleindustria.org).
