# Initial Setup: Creating the Blank Canvas

## Setting Up Your Tools

We'll be using JS Bin to write code in this tutorial. You have the experience
and want to use your editor, please do but the directions will be clearer if you
are using JS Bin.

1. Make sure you have [created a JS Bin account](#) `TODO: Create JS Bin Account
   Creation Tutorial`.
2. Then open this [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/rekofi/26/edit?js,output).
   It has all the starter code we need for this tutorial. You will write any new
   code in this JS Bin . We'll refer to this JS as your **_"working bin"_**.
