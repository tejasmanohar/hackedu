# Maze Game

We are going to learn how to use [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) and
[p5.play.js](p5play.molleindustria.org) to build a game similar to the [Scary
Maze Game](http://www.playscarymazegame.net/play-scary-maze-game/).

This tutorial is built for both complete beginners who have never written a
single line of code before to people who have programmed for years.

## How to Use This Tutorial

We designed this tutorial so you don't have to do everything step-by-step.
You're expected to jump around a bit!

You might:

- only look at the code examples and not the explanations
- only look at the toppings section
- try to build the game yourself and only look at the tutorial when you get stuck

Don't be afraid to jump around!
