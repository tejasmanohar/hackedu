## Outcome of This Step

After you finish this step, you will learn how to to add the goal sprite. Here
is the code you will end up with (_the new code is highlighted in gray_):

## Adding the Ball Sprite

Create ball sprite in a similar way that you created the player sprite in
[step 2](add_player_sprite.md).

Here's the code that contains the new code to add a ball sprite:

```js
var player;
var ball;                                  // <-- NEW

function setup() {
  createCanvas(250, 500);

  player = createSprite(125, 400, 50, 50);
  ball = createSprite(125, 250, 25, 25);   // <-- NEW
}

function draw() {
  background(255, 240, 220);
  drawSprites();

  player.position.x = mouseX;
  player.position.y = mouseY;
}
```

- [ ] _Go ahead and add these two new lines of code. If you don't quite
       understand how they work, feel free to review [step 2]
       (add_player_sprite.md)._

If you look at the above animation, you will see that the player sprite
does not move the ball around.

## Making the Player Sprite Be Able to Move the Ball Around

All we need to do is add this simple piece of code:

```js
ball.bounce(player)
```

The above line of code can be interpreted as "make the **`ball`** **`bounce`**
against the **`player`**".

- [ ] _Let's add the above line of code to our code:_

### And that's a wrap

The section immediately below section is the "Give me a brief overview of this
code". You already did the "Walk me through this code step-by-step" section
so no need to do it.

# Brief Overview of the Code

Reproduced below is the code that adds a ball and lets the player move it
around.

New lines marked with
`// <-- NEW LINE`.

```js
var player;
var ball;                                 // <-- NEW               

function setup() {
  createCanvas(250, 500);

  player = createSprite(125, 400, 50, 50);
  ball = createSprite(125, 250, 25, 25);  // <-- NEW
}

function draw() {
  background(255, 240, 220);
  drawSprites();

  player.position.x = mouseX;
  player.position.y = mouseY;

  ball.bounce(player);                    // <-- NEW
}
```

- [ ] Go ahead and add the `NEW` lines to your code:

## Understanding New Concepts

```js
ball.bounce(player)
```

The above line of code can be interpreted as "make the **`ball`** **`bounce`**
against the **`player`**".
